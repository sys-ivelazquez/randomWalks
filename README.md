# Correlated Random Walk and Lévy Flight Simulations

As a comment, I don't know why here in GitHub some plots don't appear, but if you run the code in Jupyter Notebook it appears correctly.

This project implements several activities based on stochastic processes, focusing on Correlated Random Walk (CRW) and Lévy flight distributions. Each activity simulates different aspects of these processes and visualizes the results using Plotly and Matplotlib.

## Activities Overview

### Activity 1: Correlated Random Walk - 1 Trajectory
- Description: A single trajectory of a correlated random walk is generated by selecting rotations from a Cauchy distribution.
- Key Features:
    - Rotation angles selected from a Cauchy distribution.
    - Implementation using a Vec2d class.
    - Visualization in 2D using Plotly.

### Activity 2: Lévy Distribution - N Different Curves
- Description: Multiple curves of the Lévy distribution with varying alpha values are generated. The alpha parameter controls the distribution's behavior.
- Key Features:
    - Four different curves are generated for varying values of alpha (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5).
    - m = 3.0 and beta = 0 are used as fixed parameters.
    - Visualization in 2D using Plotly.

### Activity 3: Lévy Distribution - Histogram + Curve
- Description: A histogram is generated from random values drawn from a Lévy stable distribution, and the corresponding probability density function (PDF) curve is overlaid for comparison.
- Key Features:
    - Histogram plotted using Matplotlib.
    - Lévy distribution curve compared with the histogram.

### Activity 4: Lévy Flight - Vec2d - 1 Trajectory
- Description: A single trajectory of a Lévy flight process is simulated, which involves random movements influenced by a Lévy distribution.
- Key Features:
    - The Lévy flight process is implemented using the Vec2d class.
    - Visualization in 3D using Plotly.

### Activity 5: Correlated Random Walk - Vec2d - N Trajectories
- Description: Multiple correlated random walk trajectories are generated, each using a unique Cauchy coefficient for the correlation.
- Key Features:
    - n_traj determines the number of trajectories to generate.
    - Each trajectory is simulated using a unique Cauchy correlation.
    - Visualization in 3D using Plotly.
